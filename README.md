# yepp

This is a personal (fun) project that I'm working on while learning Go. I encountered challenges in finding a project idea that goes beyond the typical task planner or tic-tac-toe. As a result, I decided to venture into creating a highly experimental (not intended for production) package manager of sorts.

The concept involves extracting a `<username>/<repo>` combination from an upstream source and displaying the corresponding version numbers on the screen. It's a wild and innovative exploration into package management within the context of my learning journey with Go.


    Release version for https://github.com/derailed/k9s: v0.31.8
    Release version for https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s: v1.29.1+k3s2
    Release version for https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell: 3.7.0
    Release version for https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty: v0.13.1
    Release version for https://github.com/neovim/neovim: v0.9.5
    Release version for https://github.com/ogham/exa: v0.10.1
    Release version for https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit: v0.40.2

Moving forward, my goal is to explore the possibility of installing all these packages on my machine using `yepp`. 
Naturally, the first step is to determine the availability of binaries. The direction of this exploration is open-ended, and I don't have a fixed roadmap in mind. I'm looking forward to the journey, aiming to have an enjoyable experience while learning Go.
